ok what do we have to do for the audiocpu:
- wait for ram to be available
- write the vector table to ram
- init duart:
movea.l $280001, A0
move.b #$40, ($18,A0)
move.w #$9C4,D0
movep.w D0,($C,A0)
move.b #$30, ($8,A0)
move.b ($1C,A0), D0
move.b #$8, ($A,A0)

 - 

- let's ignore the otis and esp for now i guess.

DUART struct
      db
MRA   db
DUART endstruct


lea $280000+1, A0
move.b #$40, ($C<<1,A0)



ugh i'm so tired..
i want to just go through and rewrite this now, without copying the original code
- init ram
- disable otis
- disable esp
- set up duart registers (enable channel b only)
- etc.

we want:
- read input bytes, send them to dpram
- send output bytes for printing info
- some way for the main cpu to also talk in the other direction? (this is less important and maybe we should just like, beyond a status code, not worry about this)

and then
